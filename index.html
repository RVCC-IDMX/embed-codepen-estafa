                <h2>Pen: Magic Card</h2>
                <h3>by Gayane Gasparyan</h3>
                <p>
                    In this pen, the author has created a card-shaped element with
                    a border that glows and spins around. If you hover on the card,
                    it removes the spinning, glowing border and reveals text which 
                    says "Magic Card". This effect is achieved by creating a linear 
                    gradient and animating it so that it spins. They use @keyframes 
                    to spin the border and @property to create a variable
                    called --rotate, which can be controlled in @keyframes. In the 
                    @property they set the syntax to be "&lt;angle&gt;" which makes it clear 
                    that it only takes angle values/degrees. In the @keyframe,s, it 
                    changes the value of the variable --rotate from 0deg to 360deg.
                    Both ::before and ::after having a z-index of -1 to move the 
                    gradient behind the card element. There also happens to be some 
                    text underneath the card element which seems to disappear 
                    when the text is hovered. In reality, it never disappears; it
                    was showing up due to the colored glow of the border. Since 
                    the text was permanently colored the same as the background. They 
                    also use :root to setup two variables --card-height and --card-width
                    which are used in making the glow effect.
